about_me:
  - I am an experienced software consultant and architect who works with companies of all sizes to help them solve business challenges through innovative software solutions. I have 12+ years experience as a software engineer and entrepreneur in a wide range of disciplines from scalability and big data, to web application development (front and back end), to mobile development.
  - My experience in the fast-paced world of software startups has allowed me to hone my ability to build light weight, flexible solutions that will last in the face of rapidly changing business needs. I pride myself on providing my clients with solutions that are both cost effective and resilient to those future needs.
  # I know that no single approach is the right one for every problem. I believe that my depth and bredth of experience allows me to find the best solution for my clients.
  - When I'm not working on software, I can usually be found building something new, working on my sailboat, or out for a run.

interests:
  - <b><u>Data, Search, and Machine Learning</u></b> Data is quickly becoming the most valuable asset most companies possess. Sadly, most don't have the knowledge or resources to properly weld it. Over the past few years, I've been helping my clients unlock and access the value in their data to drive better business decision making, improve efficiency, and build new products.
  - <b><u>3D Printing</u></b> I've long been excited about the possibilities that 3D printing unlocks for makers like myself. I designed and built my own 3D printer, and currently use it regularly in my other inventions.
  - <b><u>Making Stuff</u></b> When I'm not working on software, I like to build things. For example, I've built a sous vide machine, so that I can have great food. And I'm currently working on a custom electronic engine control system for my sailboat. And of course, I built my 3d printer, so that I can build more things.
projects:
  - <b><u>Venturi</u></b> Venturi is light weight, fast, scalable general purpose data processing engine built in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. Venturi can be used to augment, aggregate, normalize, or otherwise transform data so that it can be used in things like real time insights, analytics, monitoring, or just about any product that uses data.  Ask me how Venturi can help you in your project!
